## Summary

Solana Immune System is a multi-agent autonomous swarm that protects the Solana ecosystem from scams, rug pulls, and malicious contracts in real-time.

### Key Features

1. **10 Specialized AI Agents** operating 24/7 without human intervention
2. **Verifiable On-chain Reasoning** - every decision is cryptographically committed before execution
3. **Claude Opus Integration** - sophisticated AI analysis for threat detection
4. **Swarm Coordination** - agents collaborate and reach consensus on complex threats
5. **Real-time Protection** - detect and block threats in seconds, not hours

## Problem

- $3.4B stolen from DeFi in 2025
- 93% of new DEX pools are scams
- Current security is reactive, not proactive
- AI black boxes create trust issues

## Solution

An autonomous immune system for Solana with:
- Proactive threat detection
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Transparent, verifiable AI reasoning
- Open source infrastructure

---

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Solana/Anchor)
1. **reasoning-registry** - On-chain reasoning transparency
2. **threat-intelligence** - Decentralized threat database
3. **agent-coordinator** - Swarm coordination & consensus
